# async-flow
Salesforce invocable method for running Flows asynchronously

This isn't necessarily that "dynamic". Flows can only be called using strongly-typed Apex, so as such you need to replace `FLOW_API_NAME` in the class with your specific Flow Name. 

Currently accepts up to 3x parameters but you can add additional as required.
